<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>

<p>Photo MaxUp (“<strong>Photo MaxUp</strong>”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) provides a mobile and web service that enhances user photos for dating-profile use (the “<strong>Service</strong>”). This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

<div class="box">
  <strong>Quick Summary</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>We process the photos you upload to generate style variations. Source and generated images are automatically deleted from our servers within <strong>24 hours</strong> unless you explicitly save them to your device or cloud.</li>
    <li>Payments are handled by Apple (In‑App Purchase / Apple Pay), Google (Play Billing / Google Pay), or Stripe. We do <strong>not</strong> store full card numbers.</li>
    <li>Sign‑in (if used) may be provided via <strong>Apple Sign‑In</strong> and/or <strong>Google Sign‑In</strong>. We receive only basic profile info (e.g., name, email) needed to authenticate you.</li>
    <li>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@photomaxup.app">privacy@photomaxup.app</a> to exercise your privacy rights.</li>
    <li>The Service is intended for individuals <strong>18+</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Photos & image metadata</strong>: images you upload and the outputs we generate. Face likeness is processed only to preserve identity in the output; we do not use it to identify you or others.</li>
  <li><strong>Account data</strong> (if you create an account or use third‑party sign‑in): name, email, and auth tokens from Apple/Google necessary to log you in.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment data</strong>: purchase receipts, transaction IDs, amounts, and status from Apple, Google, or Stripe. We never store card numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage & device data</strong>: device model, OS, app version, IP‑derived region, language, crash logs, and diagnostics to maintain reliability and prevent abuse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide and improve the Service, including processing your photos to deliver selected styles.</li>
  <li>Operate, secure, and troubleshoot (fraud prevention, abuse detection, analytics, and support).</li>
  <li>Comply with legal, accounting, and tax obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Uploaded photos and generated images are automatically deleted within <strong>24 hours</strong> of processing completion. Minimal operational logs (request IDs, timestamps, non‑image diagnostics) may be retained for up to <strong>30 days</strong>. Purchase records may be retained as required by law.</p>

<h2>Sharing & Service Providers</h2>
<p>We share data with vendors who help us operate the Service, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cloud hosting & storage for secure processing and temporary storage.</li>
  <li>AI inference providers that transform photos based on your chosen style.</li>
  <li>Payments (Apple, Google, Stripe).</li>
  <li>Crash reporting and analytics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vendors access only what is necessary to perform their work and are bound by contractual confidentiality and data‑protection obligations.</p>

<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. We use appropriate safeguards (e.g., contractual commitments) to protect it.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of your information. Contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@photomaxup.app">privacy@photomaxup.app</a>. You can also delete outputs saved on your device at any time.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We employ technical and organizational measures (encryption‑in‑transit, access controls) to protect your information. No system is perfectly secure, but we continually work to safeguard data.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>The Service is intended for individuals <strong>18 years and older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

<h2>Developer & Partners</h2>
<p>Certain portions of the app were developed in partnership with PT Kreasi Teknologi Imajinasi (KREATALE). After delivery and handover, they do not retain access to user data. Third‑party platforms (Apple, Google, Stripe) process data under their own privacy policies.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
