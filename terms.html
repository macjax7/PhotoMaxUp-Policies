<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="muted">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>

<p>These Terms govern your access to and use of Photo MaxUp’s mobile apps and website (the “Service”). By using the Service you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be <strong>18 years or older</strong> to use the Service.</p>

<h2>2. The Service</h2>
<p>Photo MaxUp provides photo enhancement and style generation for dating‑profile use. Outputs vary based on the input photos and chosen style.</p>

<h2>3. Accounts & Sign‑In</h2>
<p>Accounts are optional. If you create one or use Apple/Google Sign‑In, you’re responsible for your credentials and all activity under your account.</p>

<h2>4. Your Content</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You retain ownership of photos you upload.</li>
  <li>You grant us a limited license to host, process, and temporarily store your photos and generated outputs solely to operate the Service and deliver your selected styles.</li>
  <li>We automatically delete uploaded and generated images from our servers within <strong>24 hours</strong>, unless you explicitly save them elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not upload unlawful, hateful, harassing, or sexually explicit content.</li>
  <li>Do not infringe others’ rights (privacy, publicity, or intellectual property).</li>
  <li>Do not attempt to identify or impersonate other people using generated outputs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Payments</h2>
<p>Styles are purchased on a pay‑per‑style basis (e.g., USD $2 per style) via Apple App Store, Google Play Billing, or Stripe. Purchases are final except where required by law. Taxes may apply.</p>

<h2>7. Third‑Party Services</h2>
<p>The Service integrates third‑party providers (Apple, Google, Stripe, hosting, and AI inference). Your use of those features may be subject to their terms and policies.</p>

<h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The Service (software, brand assets, and content excluding your photos) is owned by us and our licensors. You may not reverse engineer or create derivative works except as permitted by law.</p>

<h2>9. Warranty; 7‑Day Bug‑Fix Window</h2>
<p>Following each production release, we provide a <strong>7‑day warranty period</strong> for minor bug fixes and performance optimizations. New features or change requests may incur additional costs.</p>

<h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
<p>The Service is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee specific outcomes on dating platforms (e.g., matches). To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement.</p>

<h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, Photo MaxUp will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, data, or goodwill. Our aggregate liability will not exceed the amounts you paid to us for the Service in the 3 months before the claim.</p>

<h2>12. Termination</h2>
<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms or to protect the Service and other users.</p>

<h2>13. Ownership & Contractor Notice</h2>
<p>All source code and intellectual property for Photo MaxUp belong to the app owner after full payment to the contracted developer (PT Kreasi Teknologi Imajinasi, KREATALE), per the signed agreement. Contractors do not retain access to user data post‑handover.</p>

<h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your State/Country]. Courts located in [Venue] shall have exclusive jurisdiction, unless applicable law provides otherwise.</p>

<h2>15. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be effective prospectively and posted here with a new “Last updated” date.</p>
